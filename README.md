# Python Project Template

This repository serves as a template for creating new Python projects. It provides a basic structure and configuration to get started quickly.

## Purpose

This template aims to streamline the setup process for new Python projects by providing a standardized layout, dependency management configuration, and basic example files. It helps avoid the repetitive setup tasks involved in starting a new project.

## Using the Template
0.  **Fine-tune**
    *   Review the copilot instructions if you also use microsoft copilot
    *   The instruction is extreme personal favor
1.  **Clone or Copy:**
    *   Use this repository as a template on GitHub (click "Use this template").
    *   Alternatively, clone or download the repository and manually copy the files to your new project directory.
2.  **Rename Project:**
    *   Rename the `pyprojectname` directory to your actual project's name.
    *   Update the project name in `pyproject.toml`.
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv pip install -e .[dev]
    ```
4.  **Start Developing:** Begin adding your project's code and tests.

## Development Guide (Using This Template)

*   **Dependencies:** Manage dependencies using `uv` and `pyproject.toml`. Add runtime dependencies under `[project.dependencies]` and development dependencies under `[project.optional-dependencies]`.
*   **Structure:** Place your library code within the main project directory (e.g., `your_project_name/`). Write tests in the `tests/` directory.
*   **Entry Points:** Configure command-line scripts or module execution (`python -m your_project_name`) in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.scripts]` or `[project.entry-points."console_scripts"]`.
*   **Testing:** Run tests using `pytest`. Ensure good test coverage.
*   **Linting/Formatting:** Use `ruff` or `black` to maintain code style.
