# pyfilechunker Pipeline Project

## Overview
This project implements a data processing pipeline using Python, designed to handle large datasets efficiently through parallel processing. The pipeline consists of producer and consumer tasks that read, parse, and aggregate data from input files.

## Components

### src/__init__.py
This file marks the directory as a Python package and can be used to initialize package-level variables or imports.

### src/main.py
This file orchestrates the pipeline, loading settings, preparing directories, and managing the execution of producer and consumer tasks. It also handles progress monitoring and aggregates results.

### src/Tasks.py
This file defines the task settings and parsing logic. It includes the `TaskSettings` class for configuration and functions like `parse_record`, `producer_task`, and `consumer_task` for processing records.

### src/TaskManager.py
This file manages the execution of tasks using multiprocessing. It includes the `TaskManager` class, which handles task registration, progress tracking, and worker management. It also contains the `task_decorator` function to capture progress and results.

### src/pyfilechunker.py
This file contains the logic to find boundaries in a file for chunking. It includes the `find_boundaries` function, which identifies safe record boundaries for parallel processing.

### tests/__init__.py
This file marks the directory as a Python package for tests.

### tests/huabiao.txt
This file is a sample input file used for testing the pipeline.

### .gitignore
This file specifies files and directories that should be ignored by version control.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies (if any) using pip.
4. Ensure that the input file `tests/huabiao.txt` is present for testing.

## Usage
To run the pipeline, execute the `main.py` script. This will initiate the processing of the input file, utilizing the defined producer and consumer tasks.
