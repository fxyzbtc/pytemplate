## PyExtractIt Test Suite Improvements

### ✅ **Completed Improvements:**

#### 1. **Moved Temporary Files to Tests Directory**
- Created `tests/fixtures/` directory for test data files
- Added `tests/fixtures/foo.txt` and `tests/fixtures/bar.log` as sample files
- Created `tests/create_fixtures.py` to generate nested archive fixtures dynamically

#### 2. **Improved test_nested_archive.py**
- Converted from standalone test script to proper demo script
- Now uses temporary directories and fixtures properly
- Demonstrates all key features with detailed output
- Shows real-time content preview and extraction statistics

#### 3. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite**
- Added `tests/test_nested_archive_extraction.py` with 11 test cases
- Uses pytest framework with proper fixtures and assertions
- Tests both positive and negative scenarios
- Validates all new features:
  - Sequential naming (prefix_filename_sn1, sn2, etc.)
  - Filename-only pattern matching
  - Deep recursive extraction
  - Unlimited vs limited depth extraction
  - Content preservation
  - Multiple archive format support

#### 4. **Fixed Depth Limiting Logic**
- Corrected the depth limiting behavior for `unlimited_depth=False`
- Now properly respects depth limits when configured
- Added proper depth checking for nested archive processing

### 🧪 **Test Coverage:**

**Positive Tests:**
- ✅ Sequential naming for .txt files
- ✅ Sequential naming for .log files  
- ✅ Sequential naming for multiple files
- ✅ Exact filename matching
- ✅ Unlimited depth extraction
- ✅ File content preservation
- ✅ Multiple archive format support

**Negative Tests:**
- ✅ Patterns that match nothing (.pdf extension)
- ✅ Very specific patterns that match nothing
- ✅ Path-based patterns (should fail with filename-only matching)
- ✅ Limited depth extraction (respects depth limits)

### 📁 **Project Structure:**
```
tests/
├── fixtures/
│   ├── foo.txt              # Sample text file for testing
│   └── bar.log              # Sample log file for testing
├── create_fixtures.py       # Creates nested archive fixtures
├── test_nested_archive_extraction.py  # Comprehensive test suite
└── ... (other existing tests)

test_nested_archive.py       # Demo script showing functionality
```

### 🎯 **Key Features Validated:**

1. **Deep Recursive Extraction**: Extracts files from ZIP → TAR → TAR.GZ (3 levels)
2. **Sequential Naming**: Files renamed as `prefix_filename_sn1.ext`, `prefix_filename_sn2.ext`
3. **Filename-Only Matching**: Patterns only match filenames, not full paths
4. **Unlimited Depth**: Target files extracted regardless of nesting depth (configurable)
5. **Multiple Formats**: Supports nested combinations of ZIP, TAR, TAR.GZ
6. **Proper Error Handling**: Negative tests validate expected behavior

### 📊 **Test Results:**
- **11/11 tests passing** ✅
- **All negative tests correctly return 0 matches** ✅
- **All positive tests find expected files with correct naming** ✅
- **Depth limiting works correctly when enabled** ✅

The test suite now provides comprehensive validation of all the enhanced PyExtractIt features while maintaining clean separation between test fixtures, test logic, and demo functionality.
